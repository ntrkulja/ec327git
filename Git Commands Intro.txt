First thing to do:
- in a folder: git init
- ls -a (will show a hidden .git folder - do not mess with this)

: git status (tells you which files in your folder are not tracked yet)
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

        readme.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

: git add readme.txt (adds the file to the staging directory?)
CAN BE IGNORED: warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in readme.txt.

$ git commit -m "My first commit"

*** Please tell me who you are.

Run

  git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
  git config --global user.name "Your Name"

to set your account's default identity.
Omit --global to set the identity only in this repository.

fatal: unable to auto-detect email address (got 'Natasa@Ruby.(none)')


git config --global user.email "ntrkulja@bu.edu"
$ git config --global user.name "Natasa"
